# Procedure

- ***Before starting the process read the instructions completely***
- Select either ***Laser Welding*** or ***Friction Stir Welding***
- If ***Laser Welding*** is selected follow the below steps.
    - Select either ***Meltpool and Temparature Evaluation*** or ***Laser Power Profile***
        - If ***Meltpool and Temparature Evaluation*** is selcted then follow the below dteps
            - Select one ***Laser-Power (in Watts)*** value from 1000, 1500 or 2000 radio buttons
            - Select one ***Scan-speed (in mm/sec)*** value from 1200, 1300 or 1500 radio buttons
            - Click on ***Submit*** button and ***wait*** for the generation of the result
            - Observe the out put below and its result
            - Repeat the experiment by entering the different values and Submit
        - If ***Laser Power Profile*** is selcted then follow the below dteps
            - Enter the value of ***Beam Diameter (cms)***
            - Enter the value of ***Power (Watts)***
            - Click on ***Submit*** button and ***wait*** for the generation of the result
            - Observe the ***Power Distribution on Focal Plane*** plot
            - Repeat the experiment by entering the different values and Submit
        - Repeat the experiment by selecting the other tecnique.
- If ***Friction Stir Welding*** is selected follow the below steps.
    - Select the ***Rotation Speed (RPM)*** from dropdown list
    - Enter the ***Weld Speed (mm/min)*** in the input box with in the range of (0-450)
    - Click on ***Submit*** button to start the process
    - Observe the calculated T***orque (N-m)*** value after the process
    - Repeat the experiment with different values
- Repeat the experiment with different Welding Technique
